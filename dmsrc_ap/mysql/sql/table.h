    Return a table metadata version.
     * for base tables, we return table_map_id.
       It is assigned from a global counter incremented for each
       new table loaded into the table definition cache (TDC).
     * for temporary tables it's table_map_id again. But for
       temporary tables table_map_id is assigned from
       thd->query_id. The latter is assigned from a thread local
       counter incremented for every new SQL statement. Since
       temporary tables are thread-local, each temporary table
       gets a unique id.
     * for everything else (views, information schema tables),
       the version id is zero.

   This choice of version id is a large compromise
   to have a working prepared statement validation in 5.1. In
   future version ids will be persistent, as described in WL#4180.

   Let's try to explain why and how this limited solution allows
   to validate prepared statements.

   Firstly, sets (in mathematical sense) of version numbers
   never intersect for different table types. Therefore,
   version id of a temporary table is never compared with
   a version id of a view, and vice versa.

   Secondly, for base tables, we know that each DDL flushes the
   respective share from the TDC. This ensures that whenever
   a table is altered or dropped and recreated, it gets a new
   version id.
   Unfortunately, since elements of the TDC are also flushed on
   LRU basis, this choice of version ids leads to false positives.
   E.g. when the TDC size is too small, we may have a SELECT
   * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES flush all its elements, which
   in turn will lead to a validation error and a subsequent
   reprepare of all prepared statements.  This is
   considered acceptable, since as long as prepared statements are
   automatically reprepared, spurious invalidation is only
   a performance hit. Besides, no better simple solution exists.

   For temporary tables, using thd->query_id ensures that if
   a temporary table was altered or recreated, a new version id is
   assigned. This suits validation needs very well and will perhaps
   never change.

   Metadata of information schema tables never changes.
   Thus we can safely assume 0 for a good enough version id.

   Views are a special and tricky case. A view is always inlined
   into the parse tree of a prepared statement at prepare.
   Thus, when we execute a prepared statement, the parse tree
   will not get modified even if the view is replaced with another
   view.  Therefore, we can safely choose 0 for version id of
   views and effectively never invalidate a prepared statement
   when a view definition is altered. Note, that this leads to
   wrong binary log in statement-based replication, since we log
   prepared statement execution in form Query_log_events
   containing conventional statements. But since there is no
   metadata locking for views, the very same problem exists for
   conventional statements alone, as reported in Bug#25144. The only
   difference between prepared and conventional execution is,
   effectively, that for prepared statements the race condition
   window is much wider.
   In 6.0 we plan to support view metadata locking (WL#3726) and
   extend table definition cache to cache views (WL#4298).
   When this is done, views will be handled in the same fashion
   as the base tables.

   Finally, by taking into account table type, we always
   track that a change has taken place when a view is replaced
   with a base table, a base table is replaced with a temporary
   table and so on.

/*
  Generic iterator over the fields of an arbitrary table reference.

  DESCRIPTION
    This class unifies the various ways of iterating over the columns
    of a table reference depending on the type of SQL entity it
    represents. If such an entity represents a nested table reference,
    this iterator encapsulates the iteration over the columns of the
    members of the table reference.

  IMPLEMENTATION
    The implementation assumes that all underlying NATURAL/USING table
    references already contain their result columns and are linked into
    the list TABLE_LIST::next_name_resolution_table.
